# Time-Series-Interpolation
The repository consists of techniques for time series analysis starting from data preprocessing to forecasting.


## Motivation
There are vaious methods of interpolation of time series data staring from mean to teh various non-linear methods. But, there are very less ways to assess which of the method is best suitable for your data. In the following project I have presented techniques to compare different methodologies so that the interpolation method yields significantly precise results.
